## ABOUT THE PROJECT
This is a project made by Emeka Ugbanu for the ScandiPWA Junior React Developer role test.

It is made using Create React App and uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org) for state-manegement as well as React [Router](https://redux.js.org) for client-side routing and [Appollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) as an easy way to consume the GraphQL endpoint provided for the test.
